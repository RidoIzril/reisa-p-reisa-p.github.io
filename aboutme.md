So hi, just call me Rei. I'm interested in building solutions using IT. Currently immersed in Data Science for Business Intelligence. Below is my education path :

- Graduate as Master of Computer (M.Kom) from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Indonesia
- Exchange student on Master of Sytem and Control from Gheorghe Asachi Technical University, Romania --- as Erasmus Scholarschip awardee

I've been working since 2012, vary from behind desk with my laptop, or in front of class watched by students.
